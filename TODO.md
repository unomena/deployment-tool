# Deployment Tool - Next Steps

## Current Status âœ…
- âœ… Modular architecture implemented with lightweight Python orchestrator
- âœ… Simplified deployment interface (`./deploy <repo_url> <branch> <env>`)
- âœ… Virtual environment separation between deployment tool and projects
- âœ… All scripts updated for correct venv context
- âœ… Environment-based config selection (deploy-prod.yml, deploy-dev.yml, etc.)

## Next Steps for Ubuntu Server Testing ðŸš€

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Testing
- [ ] **Deploy to Ubuntu Server**
  - Clone this repository to Ubuntu server: `git clone git@github.com:unomena/deployment-tool.git`
  - Set up deployment tool's own virtual environment: `make build`
  - Test basic functionality with `./deploy --help`

- [ ] **System Dependencies Installation**
  - Install required system packages for deployment tool:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y git python3 python3-venv python3-dev build-essential
    ```
  - Test system dependency installation script:
    ```bash
    export SYSTEM_DEPENDENCIES='["supervisor", "nginx", "postgresql", "redis-server"]'
    ./scripts/install-system-dependencies.sh
    ```

- [ ] **Basic Deployment Test**
  - Create a minimal test deployment config (`test-deploy.yml`)
  - Test with a simple Django project repository
  - Verify all deployment steps execute without errors

### Phase 2: Full Integration Testing
- [ ] **PostgreSQL Integration**
  - Install and configure PostgreSQL
  - Test database creation and user setup
  - Verify Django database connectivity

- [ ] **Supervisor Integration**
  - Test supervisor configuration generation
  - Verify supervisor configs are properly installed
  - Test service startup and process management

- [ ] **Web Server Setup**
  - Configure Nginx (if included in system dependencies)
  - Test static file serving
  - Verify reverse proxy configuration

### Phase 3: End-to-End Deployment Testing
- [ ] **Complete Django Project Deployment**
  - Deploy a full Django project with database, static files, and services
  - Test all deployment phases: setup, dependencies, database, services
  - Verify health checks and rollback mechanisms

- [ ] **Multiple Environment Testing**
  - Test dev, staging, and production environment deployments
  - Verify environment-specific configurations
  - Test branch-based deployments

### Phase 4: Robustness and Edge Cases
- [ ] **Error Handling Validation**
  - Test deployment failures and recovery
  - Verify rollback functionality
  - Test partial deployment scenarios

- [ ] **Security and Permissions**
  - Verify proper file permissions and ownership
  - Test with different user contexts
  - Validate secure credential handling

- [ ] **Performance and Logging**
  - Test deployment of large applications
  - Verify comprehensive logging throughout process
  - Monitor deployment performance and resource usage

### Phase 5: Production Readiness
- [ ] **Documentation Updates**
  - Update README with tested Ubuntu server instructions
  - Add troubleshooting guide based on testing findings
  - Create deployment checklist for production use

- [ ] **Configuration Templates**
  - Create production-ready config templates
  - Add security-focused configuration examples
  - Document best practices for each environment type

## Testing Checklist for Each Phase âœ“

For each deployment test, verify:
- [ ] Virtual environment isolation (deployment tool vs project)
- [ ] All scripts use correct Python/pip executables
- [ ] Environment variables are properly passed between scripts
- [ ] Error handling and logging work correctly
- [ ] Services start successfully and remain running
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Rollback works if deployment fails

## Known Areas Requiring Ubuntu Testing

1. **System Package Installation** - Requires `apt-get` and `sudo` privileges
2. **Supervisor Configuration** - Needs systemctl and supervisor daemon
3. **Database Setup** - Requires PostgreSQL installation and configuration
4. **File Permissions** - Different user contexts on server vs development
5. **Network Configuration** - Firewalls, ports, service binding
6. **Service Management** - systemd integration and service persistence

## Expected Issues and Solutions

### Virtual Environment Context
- **Issue**: Scripts might still use wrong Python executable
- **Solution**: Verify all `PROJECT_PYTHON_PATH` usage in Django scripts

### Permission Issues
- **Issue**: File permissions for logs, configs, code directories
- **Solution**: Add proper `chown`/`chmod` commands where needed

### Service Dependencies
- **Issue**: Services may not start due to missing dependencies
- **Solution**: Add dependency checks and installation verification

### Database Connectivity
- **Issue**: PostgreSQL authentication or network binding issues
- **Solution**: Update database configuration scripts with proper auth setup

## Success Criteria ðŸŽ¯

The deployment tool is ready for production use when:
1. Complete Django applications can be deployed end-to-end
2. All services start automatically and remain stable
3. Health checks pass consistently
4. Rollback functionality works reliably
5. Multiple environments can be managed simultaneously
6. Documentation covers all common use cases and troubleshooting
